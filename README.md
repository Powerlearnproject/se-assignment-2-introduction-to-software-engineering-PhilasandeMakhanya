4:Validation: ensuring requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are feaible to implement.
5:Management: Tracking changes to requirements and maintaining consistency throughout the project lifecycle.
Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle- Clarity: Provides a clear understanding of what needs to be built, reducing ambiguity.
2:Alignment: Ensures the final product meets stakeholder expectation and business goals.
3:Scope Management: Helps in defining the project scope, preventing scope creep.
4;Risk Reduction: Identifies potental issues early, reducing the risk of costly changes later
5:Communication: Facilitates better communication among stakeholders, developer, and testers, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

Software Design Principles:
1:Modularity: Breaking down a system in smaller, manageable modules.
2:Encapsulation: Hiding implementation details within modules.
3:Abstraction: Simplifying complex systems ny focusing on high-level operations.
4:Separation of concerns: Diveding a program into distinct features.
Dry(Do not Repeat Yourself): Avoiding redundancy.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
It involves diveding a software system into distinct, self-contained units or modules, each with a specific functionality.
1: Maintainability:
-Isolation: issues can be localized within a specific module, making debugging and updates easier.
-Readability: Smaller, focused modules are easier to understand and modify.
-Reusability: Modules can be reused across different projects, reducing development time and effort
2; Scalability;
-Independent Development: Teams can works on different modules concurrently, speeding up development.
-Incremental Growth: New features can be added as new modules without affecting existing functionality.
-Load Distribution: System load can be balanced by deploying modules across multiple servers or services.
-Separation of Concerns: Each module handles a specific aspect of functionality, reducing complexty.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Evaluates and verifies software to ensure it meets requirements and functions correctly. key types include unit, integration, system, acceptance, regression, performance, and security testing, It identifies defects early, ensure reliabilty, and enhances user satisfaction. Effective testing is crucial for delivering high-quality software, maintaining performance, and reducinh future maintenance costs.
